# ReactJS Project 3

## Redux

## Requirements

Remember the react todo app project? now clone the project and start change the project concept with redux. You can make 3 reducers. The `ADD_TODO`, `DELETE_TODO`, and `EDIT_TODO`. Instead of using the state for storing the todo data, now you can store the data into the redux store. Happy coding....
