## What for in our lession?

### 1. [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)

* we need simple web server to run on our laptop, so file with extension `html` can run on our browser
* to install `http-server`, type on our terminal / CLI (Command Line Interface) `sudo npm install http-server -g`. `-g` mean it will be installed to our laptop globaly, so on CLI we can call `http-server` on any path.

    #### Run
  * open VS code, and positioned with current project (`learn-reactjs`)
  * on VS code, type `SHIFT + ~`. it will show CLI
  * on CLI type `http-server`
  * it will give us message to open our browser with address & port they give it. so do it.
