how to make portofolio
* show your speciality
* put your best images (many)
* seeing your ideas translated into a physical product shows details that an image file can’t.
* show us your current work
* tell about you, in your own words
* We’ve all heard that basic rule of writing:  "show, don't tell"
* Keep things organized
* Let your customers help tell your story
